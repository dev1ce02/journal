     Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed
     through some interesting places on the way: 
     
  </p>
  <ol> 
  <li>Walla Walla, WA</li>
  <li>Maigc City, ID</li>
  <li>Bountiful, UT</li>
  <li>Last Chance, CO</li>
  <li>Why, AZ</li>
  <li>Truth or Consequences, NM</li>
  </ol>

    I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the
    road today: 
  </p>
    <blockquote>
      "Passing cars, <br>
      When you can't see, <br>
      May get you, <br>
      A glimpse, <br>
      Of eternity." <br>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
      I definitely won't be passing
      any cars.
    </p>

    My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got 
    everything packed and ready to go. Because I'm on a Segway,
    I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me:
    
    
    cell phone
    iPod
    digital camera
    and a protein bar
    
    
    Just the ESSENTIALS. As 
    Lao Tzu would have said, <q>A journey of a thousand 
    miles begins with one segway.</q>
